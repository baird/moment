<p>Hello! This project would not have been possible without free and open data from some great projects.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for the trend which was more difficult than it should have been. I encourage Twitter to begin using OAuth2 for user authentications. You can check out a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/397" target="_blank">thread here</a> that was started almost 4 years ago (at the time of writing) asking about this functionality.The data is free but requires a significant authorization and a custom written proxy to make the handshake. It seems due to the sheer traffic Twitter experiences they have been forced to make some tough descisions. I do find this metric facinating as a social study.</p>

<p>The quantum number is is sourced through a brilliant project you can find <a href="http://qrng.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank">here</a>. The ANU Quantum Random Number Generator uses quantum fluctuations inside a vacuum to generate random numbers. The number you find in this project each time you generate results is <i>truly</i> random. Some of you may know this is a hard thing to come by. You can even incorporate this data to modify the entropy of other projects.</p>

<p>The currency valuations are sourced from an open API provided by <a href="http://coinabul.com/" target="_blank">Coinabul</a>. They are generated on the fly and are another facinating thing to watch change.</p>

<p>The earthquake data is sourced from the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS</a>. The data shown in this project is from the most recent earthquake in the last hour measuring any magnitude. Baby earthquakes happen all the time!</p>

<p>The moon phase is sourced from the <a href="http://www.almanac.com/" target="_blank">Old Farmers Almanac</a>.</p>

<p>The current headline is sourced from <a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank">Google News</a> and like a few of the other feeds, is pulled using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/feed/" target="_blank">Google Feed API</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions feel free to <a href="https://github.com/baird" target="_blank">get in touch</a>.
